        <p>1. Can the solution to the problem/opportunity assist in diagnosing a patient’s
condition?<br>
2. Can the solution to the problem/opportunity assist in determining what the proper
drug dosage level should be?<br>
3. Can the solution to the problem/opportunity remind the appropriate care giver
about the preventative services to be administered to a patient or to patient care
related function?<br>
4. Can the solution to the problem/opportunity assist in carrying out diagnostic
procedure by recommending specific treatments or tests?<br>
5. Can the solution to the problem/opportunity assist in carrying out medical
procedures by alerts regarding potential adverse events?<br>
6. Can the solution to the problem/opportunity assist in providing cost effective
medical care by reminding previous orders, results, frequency rule checks, and
schedule of treatment or procedure?</p>
        <p>During the design phase, the problems or opportunities identified during the intelligence
phase are further analyzed to develop possible courses of actions to construct decision
models. A thorough search for ready made solutions, customized off the shelf solution,
or a decision to custom solution development is made. Modeling of a decision problem
involves identification of variables, identification of the relationship between those
variables, and developing an abstraction into quantitative or qualitative forms.<br>
During the choice phase, the actual decision to follow a certain course of action is made.
If a single option results from the design phase, the choice phase is a simple acceptance
or rejection of the option. If multiple courses of actions are identified in the design phase,
then the decision makers are challenged in choosing from multiple conflicting objectives.
Some decision rules for multivariable problems have applied strategies like holistic
evaluation methods, heuristic elimination, and holistic judgment.<br>
During the review phase, the outcomes of the decision making process are reviewed for
validity and applicability for the case in hand. Any deviation and changes to these
outcomes could very well become an expert knowledge that can be fed back into the
knowledgebase to help future decision making cases.<br>
Several studies were performed to identify the characteristics and functions of a medical
decision support system. Turban and Aronson (2000) and Beatty (1999) have performed
extensive research in this area of medical decision support system. Turban and Aronson
(2000) summarizes the characteristics into few categories as listed below.<br>
</p>
        <p>1. Support decision makers in semi structured and unstructured situations by bringing medical expert judgment and computer knowledgebase together.<br>
2. Support decision making when the problem area consists of various inter-dependent and/or sequential paths.<br>
3. Should be adaptive and flexible in nature. This allows new learning, adjustments
to current knowledge and knowledge pattern recognition.</p>

        <p>4. User friendliness is a key for success. Even a great decision support system can
be useless if the users are challenged by its interface. This is particularly true in
the case of healthcare arena. The system should be easy, fast, and require few
mouse clicks by physicians.<br>
5. Allow decision makers to construct simple decision constructs.<br>
6. Should provide both automated and interactive decision support depending on the
nature of the problem/opportunity.<br>
7. Should provide complete control to the medical decision maker and should not
attempt to replace the clinician’s judgment.</p>
        <p>Beatty (1999) conducted an empirical study about the characteristics and functions of
a medical decision support system. This study provided several interesting findings on
what support do medical decision makers expect during a decision making process.
Similar to Turban and Aronson (2000) study, Beatty’s (1999) finding also indicates that
the decision makers favored characteristics in a decision support system that advised
or guided rather than controlled. Thus, medical decision makers prefer to be in total
control during the decision making process and would use the computerized system as
a support or assistance during the process.<br>
Beatty’s (1999) finding also differentiated between the expectations of a medical user
from a non medical user in medical decision making. This is an important variation in a
medical setting as several non medical people perform various routine functions in a
medical setting and medical decision support systems could assist their functions as
well. The interesting finding is that the non medical users prefer to give more control and
trust to the decision support system while the medical users prefer to keep control.<br>
Medical decision support systems should be capable to operate in both an offline mode
and a real time mode. This allows the system to be used as an educational tool during
offline mode and as an advisor during the real time mode. Beatty (1999) indicates that the
users prefer a detailed advice about a medical problem, treatment option, and so on,
preferably through flow diagrams or case studies but a real time support should be clear,
precise, alarms, and very sophisticated. The knowledge base for the decision support
systems should be gathered from literature, case studies, and wide group of experts.<br>
Turban & Aronson (2000) used a schematic view to describe the components of a
decision support system. This view was used as a guideline to develop a schematic view
to identify the components of a medical decision support system. As depicted in Figure
1, a typical medical decision support system consists of a medical decision support model
database, a medical data management component, a medical decision support engine,
third party objects including medical databases and rules, decision support sub systems,
and a decision support user interface. The decision support model database contains all
the tables and data needed to support the decision support models. The data needed for
development of rules engine, prediction models, and protocols are stored in the model
database.<br>
The medical data management component is the critical part of the medical decision
support system. This interfaces with the databases external to the decision support</p>

        <p>system to allow the decision support engine and third party interfaces to apply model
database rule on the medical data to arrive at intelligent decisions.<br>
The medical decision support engine is a set of programs that constitute the model for
decision support. It was important to develop a flexible engine that could be data-driven.
Several day-to-day decisions in patient care are based on changing regulations and
practice guidelines. These guidelines are periodically reviewed and changed. In order to
expedite such decision rule changes, it is important to maintain the rules themselves in
databases, thus making the model database a meta-database.<br>
There are a few decision support processes that are available commercially. These third
party objects may or may not include the model database bundled within the object. If
they are bundled, it would become a direct interface with the decision support subsystem
and the data management system. If they are not bundled, then the data is carefully placed
either in the model database or in the medical database as appropriate.<br>
Decision support subsystems are independent decision support systems that can
interface with any external subsystem directly or through the decision support user
interface. The medical decision support system generally consists of both automated and
interactive subsystems. The automated decision support subsystems may use the
automated engine to integrate the automated decision making capabilities with existing
automated functions. For decision support functions that require user interaction, the
decision support system flexible interface is called from the user interface layer and
presented to the decision maker.</p>

        <img class="img2" src="Screenshot%20(44).png">
        <p>In the past four decades, numerous medical decision support systems were developed
using a wide range of techniques such as automated reasoning, natural language processing, game playing, automatic programming, robotics, machine learning, and expert systems.
These decision support systems generally address the medical decision support functions
listed in Table 1 (Raghavan, Ladik, & Meyer, 2005). These functions are generic in nature,
while the knowledge base of the decision support systems is generally specific to a medical
domain area like oncology, nephrology, pediatrics, and so on.<br>
The most common decision support function found in medical decision support systems
is alerts and reminders. In a real time environment, these decision support functions are
attached to the monitoring devices to provide immediate alerts as and when the trigger
condition occurs. For example, the oxygen and blood pressure monitors in an acute
setting can alert the nurses if the patient’s condition goes beyond the set threshold
value. In a chronic setting, a simple scan of laboratory results and an email or pager alert
to the corresponding decision maker are valuable decision support functions. A few
medical decision support systems can provide image recognition and interpretation
functions. These are extremely helpful in large hospitals where various radiology reports
can be interpreted and alerts can be generated to gain the attention of the experts.<br>
Diagnostic support is a key function that several medical decision support systems
attempt to offer to help the physicians in detecting the problem based on symptoms and
etiology. Such systems are commonly used to detect rare diseases and also as an aid for
inexperienced practitioners. A few medical decision support systems offer care plan<br>critiques by looking at data inconsistencies, errors, and omissions against practice
guidelines.<br>
In the next section, the problem domain, and the decision support functions provided by
various popular medical decision support systems will be discussed. While there are
close to hundred known medical decision support systems in use, the most popular
medical decision support systems based on the existing literature and usage will be
discussed in this chapter.</p>
        <h2><b>Medical Decision Support Systems</b></h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h3><b>HELP (Health Evaluation through Logical Processes)</b></h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>This is the most successful and popular medical decision support system in the United
States. The HELP system of the Latter Day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City is a hospitalbased medical information system that gives practitioners a comprehensive patient
record with decision support capabilities. HELP is a comprehensive medical information
system with full fledged medical records, physician order entry, charges, radiology,
pharmacy, ICU monitoring, laboratory, and robust decision support functions (MedExpertHELP, 2004).<br>
The success of HELP information system was due to the fact that the decision support
functions were integrated with the hospital information system. The availability of
required data and the knowledge base makes this a powerful system. The decision
support capabilities made available to the decision makers at the point of care made this
an effective product. This system has also been implemented at more than twenty
hospitals.<br>
The HELP information system supports the following decision support functions: alerts
and reminders, decision critiquing, patient diagnosis, care suggestions, and protocols.
The integrated laboratory information system allows automatic monitoring and alerts for
abnormalities or out of range values. The critiquing feature is integrated within the
transfusion ordering module to critique the reason provided against the strict guidelines.
The system also includes modules such as automated surveillance system that uses
various data elements to diagnose nosocomial infections. As an extension of this module,
the antibiotic assistant recommends the antibiotics that can produce optimal benefit to
the patient.</p>
        <h3><b>DXplain</b></h3>
         <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Dxplain is a diagnostic decision support system that is owned by Massachusetts General
Hospital and can be licensed and accessed over the internet as well. DXplain is a powerful
diagnosis decision support system used in general medicine. The power of DXplain is
its knowledge base that can diagnose close to 2000 diseases emphasizing the signs and</p>
